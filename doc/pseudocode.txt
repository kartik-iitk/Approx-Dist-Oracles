preprocess() {
    1. Landmark Creation multi-level
        - Create a vector of vectors for each level of length (k + 1) with last entry null for exiting loop.
        - Initial level consists of all input vertices.
    2. Level-wise Multi-source dijstra for storing distance to all nodes of lower level in the higher level.
        and simultaneously store the landmark association of every vertex at every level.
        - Works by adding a dummy node 
    3. Ball Computation in the form of hash table
}

query() {
    1. Front-Back strategy of computing distance
    Note: This should be able to handle all cases (input can be landmark or not) properly.
}


Levels are 0-indexed

Landmark[k + 1] = chosen vertex at sampling i, last sampling is empty (a vertex which is in sampling i was also part of all the samplings of samplings <= i; we can define rank/level as the highest sampling to which a vertex can belong)
Focus[v][i] = Closest landmark of vertex v from landmarks of sampling i.
Ball[v] = For vertex v, stores a unordered map (hash-table) of pairs of (vertex, distance) of curated vertices.

Insights:
1. choosing non-increasing sequence of landmark vertices is done so that we can ensure that focus of higher level is always the same or farther than the lower level.
2. The stretch need not always be large, as the query can return before that when the stretch is lower.
