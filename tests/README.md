1. `graph.txt`: On each line, `vertex1, vertex2, edge_weight`
2. `parameter.txt`: On each line,
   n # Number of vertices
   m # Number of edges
   k # For the algorithm
   test_mode # To set if landmarks are chosen randomly or input by the user.
3. `queries.txt`: On each line, `vertex1, vertex2`

In the out directory,

1. `landmarks.txt`: On each line, all the vertices which are landmarks
2. `answers.txt`: The output of each query given the landmarks of each sampling.
